# Simulation
 Weve created a simulation with R studio and R-Markdown for the Olimpic games
 We checked distributions with R mark down and tested the values of the simulation
 We used Rstudio in order to simulate the story and we choose 2 alternatives and moduled them
 In order to choose which alternative makes our simulaiton the best, we choose 3 aspects
 We used SQL to get the aspects needed
 We checked the distributon of the ascpects in R mark down
 And we calculated how much runs needed in our simulation in order to get the values needed (statistic wise)
 We run our simulation with the new number of runs and we used t tests in order to test our results
 
 In the end we choose the best alternative that fitted our cause.
